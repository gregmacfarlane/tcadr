Description: Caliper's TransCAD application and GISDK language are widely used
    in travel demand modeling applications. However, it can be difficult to conduct
    complex analyses with these tools, because the file formats are unique and/or
    non-standard. This package contains helper scripts to read TransCAD files for use
    in R.
