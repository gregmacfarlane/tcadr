tcadr
==============

This is a library of functions that can be used to read native TransCAD files
directly into R without intermediate conversion to `.csv` or `.dbf`. Currently 
the package will read binary data tables (including network attributes), but I 
hope to extend the package to cover shape data and networks in the future.

Installation
--------------

    devtools::install_github("gregmacfarlane/tcadr")
    
Use
--------------

    ?read_tcad_bin()
    

This package is under active development, and any contribution is welcome.
